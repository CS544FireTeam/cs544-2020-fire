The software systems development life cycle (SDLC) has three major phases. It begins with preliminary and feasibility studies to make the decision to develop a system to solve a particular problem in a cost-effective and timely way. This is followed by a detailed system study, in which every aspect of the current system is analyzed and a new system is designed to meet the needs of the organization. Finally, the system design is brought to life through software engineering techniques including coding, testing, implementation and maintenance of the system. This course focuses on the middle phase. A system is studied in detail to gather requirements and its process elements analyzed for suitability and relevance to meet the needs of the systemâ€™s users.
